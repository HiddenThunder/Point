# Roadmap

It is for you dear reader to have some sense of what I think this project could be

## So far it has:

- Public channels
- Personal channels for tet-a-tet converstaion
- Encryption (secp256k1 only) for both types

My last milestone was to establish proper handshake for personal conversations :stars:

Right now I am thinking about two things that I'll work on in the near future:

### Profile

I want to create profiles, which is profile pic and nickname :strawberry: And everyone will see others usernames and profile pics!

### History

Right now I don't have a good solution to this. i think. At least I have some approaches. Here we have two ways

- store history locally for every user (which will be an option - ofc!). the good question here is how to fetch history from the network :question:

- store history in decentralized storage, and filecoin here is a great thing! Maybe I'll use it with [Web3 storage](https://web3.storage)

This is everythin I have to say. i think

Shine bright :white_flower:
